Pacman_INF-D
============

Project Pacman INF-D

## Information for this project

The project is created with the Netbeans IDE and build with ANT

## Requirements 

- Ant 1.8 or higher (See if it's very useful)

- JUnit4 for the unit tests

## Todo

- Pacman doesn't correctly react when we want to change its direction.

- The orientation of Pacman doesn't change when Pacman change the direction.

- Welcome Page is a white page, it must be better if we have a picture of Pacman 
    to render the game more attractive.
   
- Exceptions aren't catch like this : 
    ![javax.sound](./images/pacman_inf-D_exception.png)
    
    ![NullPointer](./images/pacman_inf-D_nullpointer.png)

- Create more unit tests.

- (See if it's possible) the movements of Pacman it's not fluid.
